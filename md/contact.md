# Contact me

Feel free to [DM me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/benjaminion_xyz/) with any feedback.

For typos, corrections, omissions and the like please either drop me a line as above, or raise a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/benjaminion/upgrading-ethereum-book/issues). I'd rather you didn't make a PR as it's easier to fix things in my upstream repo than to backport fixes.

Looking forward to hearing from you ðŸ™‚
