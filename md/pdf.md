# PDF Version

A PDF version of this edition of the book [is available](/book.pdf). The most up to date version is always [here](/../latest/book.pdf).

Please resist printing it out. The text is still a work in progress and changes constantly. I'm also quite fond of trees.

Notes:

  - The PDF formatting still has some rough edges - see [the build notes](https://github.com/benjaminion/upgrading-ethereum-book/tree/capella/bin/pdf) for the latest info.
  - It's formatted for A4 paper since that's [the ISO standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_size) and is mathematically pleasing. You can easily change this if you [build it yourself](https://github.com/benjaminion/upgrading-ethereum-book/tree/capella/bin/pdf).
